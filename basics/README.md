# Python Basics

Welcome to the Python Basics section! This part of the repository focuses on foundational Python concepts. Each subfolder contains detailed explanations and real-world examples.

## Contents
- [Data Types](./data_types/README.md): Understand Python's basic data types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- [Control Flow](./control_flow/README.md): Learn how to use control flow statements like `if`, `for`, and `while`, `match` to dictate the flow of your Python programs.
- [Functions](./functions/README.md): Dive into functions, understand how to define them, pass arguments, and use return values.

## Using This Section
- Navigate to each subfolder to find a README with theoretical explanations and practical examples (`examples.py`).
- The examples are designed to be simple yet illustrative of real-world scenarios.
- Try modifying the examples or creating your own to practice.

## Getting Started
To get the most out of this section, start with [Data Types](./data_types/README.md), then proceed to [Control Flow](./control_flow/README.md), and finally explore [Functions](./functions/README.md).

Happy Learning!
