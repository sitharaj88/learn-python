# Control Flow in Python

Control flow is essential for decision-making in programs. This section covers `if` statements, `for` and `while` loops.

## Examples
- **If statements**: Used for decision-making.
- **For loops**: Iterate over a sequence.
- **While loops**: Repeat as long as a condition is true.

See `examples.py` for real-world applications.
